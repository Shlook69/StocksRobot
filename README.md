# StocksRobot🤖
## My First Discord Bot Ever

StocksRobot is a Discord bot designed to show some stock-market data based on the user's commands.
**The bot gets the data by using the Yahoo! Finance's API (yfinance).**

- Show change in a stock's price since the last month
- Show analysts' main recommendation on a stock
- Send news links about a stock
- Allow the user to follow stocks and save a list of them as a JSON file on the bot's server
